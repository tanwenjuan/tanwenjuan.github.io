{{< project image="/img/Unilinker.jpg" title="Unilinker: A Unified Model for Linker Design in Targeted Drug Development" authors="Li Zhang, <em><u>Wenjuan Tan</u>, Ziyang Yu, Wenbing Huang*, Yang Liu*</em><br> <em><b>In Process</b></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/tanwenjuan/Unilinker' style='color: #28a745;'>Code</a>"description="In targeted drug design, the linker plays a pivotal role, often directly influencing the drug's efficacy. Targeted drugs encompass a variety of types, including polymorphs and antibody-drug conjugates, among others. To standardize the design process, we propose the Unilinker model, a unified framework for linker design applicable across different categories of targeted drugs. We have developed a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, incorporating diffusion within the latent space, to generate a comprehensive linker design approach. Furthermore, during the design process, we leverage a linker template library to guide the linker generation, with the infusion of template knowledge significantly enhancing the validity of the generated linkers. This is particularly beneficial in the design of complex linkers, ensuring more effective and optimized solutions." separator="true" >}}

{{< project image="/img/RLHF.png" title="Prototype-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLM Fine-Tuning with Sparse Human Feedback" authors="<em>Ximing Wen, <u>Wenjuan Tan</u>, Rosina O. Weber*</em><br> <em><b>In Process </b></em>" description="The answers generated by LLMs are sometimes useful, but at other times they are not. To train a better model that provides useful answers to users, fine-tuning based on user feedback is necessary. However, due to the limited amount of labeled data, fine-tuning LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) sometimes fails to achieve effective results. We propose a prototype reward model that leverages the prototype's suitability for few-shot learning, and constructs a reward model based on human feedback. The reward score generated from the output is then used to train the reinforcement learning model." separator="true" >}}

Additionally, I segmented the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles to analyze their movement, speed, and shape trajectories, creating 3D rendered animations to visualize their motion throughout the breathing process. Through statistical analysis, I identified unique respiratory characteristics among different TIS patient types, which contributed valuable insights for clinical diagnosis and treatment." separator="true" >}}

I proposed a decentralized obstacle avoidance strategy that allowed robots to autonomously adjust their formation based on local information. Additionally, I introduced a dynamic formation selection algorithm to estimate global errors from local ones, enabling robots to reconfigure formations during obstacle avoidance while maintaining coordination. I also designed a consensus-based distributed control law to ensure stable tracking of time-varying formations. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we validated the algorithmsâ€™ robustness, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This work demonstrated the potential of decentralized control to enhance the performance and flexibility of mobile robot systems in complex real-world scenarios." separator="true" >}}
