		<p class="list__lead post__lead">I am a master’s student at **Tsinghua University**, where my research focuses on the intersection of AI for Science, AI &#43; Healthcare, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of **Prof. Yang Liu &amp; Prof. Wenbing Huang**, investigating the application of AI in scientific discovery and healthcare innovation.

Before pursuing my master&#39;s, I completed a dual bachelor’s degree in Computer Science &amp; Applications and Mechanical Engineering at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, where I was part of the prestigious **Tsien Hsue-Shen Honors Program**. During my time at SJTU, I conducted robotics research under **Prof. Kai Xu** and was recognized with several academic honors, including the **Rongchang Technology Innovation Scholarship (Top 10)** and the **Fan Xuji Scholarship (Top 15)**. I was also selected for the **Zhiyuan Engineering Honor Program (Top 5%)**, a highly competitive program for top engineering students.

In addition to my academic work, I have gained hands-on experience as an intern at **Penn Medicine**, collaborating with **Prof. Jayaram Udunpa** on medical data analysis, which has further deepened my interest in the integration of AI and healthcare. I am passionate about exploring how advanced AI technologies can contribute to scientific progress and improve healthcare outcomes, and I aim to continue pursuing this research in my future career.

**Interests**: AI for drug discovery,  LLMs,  AI &#43; healthcare,  Robotics

      <p class="no-margin">I developed AiPROTACs, a deep learning model that leverages graph-based neural networks and a hybrid learning framework to predict the degradation efficacy of PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras).The model achieved an accuracy of 85.02% on both the PROTAC-DB2.0 dataset and external datasets.To validate the model's predictive capabilities, I applied it to identify potential androgen receptor-targeting PROTACs, which were synthesized and experimentally tested.Of the 16 synthesized candidates, 75% showed predicted degradation efficacy, with one lead candidate exhibiting promising in vitro degradation activity.The AiPROTACs model significantly streamlined the PROTAC discovery process, improving degradation efficiency and specificity, which in turn accelerates drug development timelines.</p>

By leveraging its enhanced representation, I applied it to small molecule and protein modeling, improving 3D structure accuracy and cross-domain learning.Experimental results showed that EPT outperformed existing methods in ligand binding affinity prediction and delivered strong performance in molecular and protein property tasks.The model showed promising results in anti-COVID drug screening.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">In targeted drug design, the linker plays a pivotal role, often directly influencing the drug's efficacy. Targeted drugs encompass a variety of types, including polymorphs and antibody-drug conjugates, among others. To standardize the design process, we propose the Unilinker model, a unified framework for linker design applicable across different categories of targeted drugs. We have developed a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, incorporating diffusion within the latent space, to generate a comprehensive linker design approach. Furthermore, during the design process, we leverage a linker template library to guide the linker generation, with the infusion of template knowledge significantly enhancing the validity of the generated linkers. This is particularly beneficial in the design of complex linkers, ensuring more effective and optimized solutions.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">The answers generated by LLMs are sometimes useful, but at other times they are not. To train a better model that provides useful answers to users, fine-tuning based on user feedback is necessary. However, due to the limited amount of labeled data, fine-tuning LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) sometimes fails to achieve effective results. We propose a prototype reward model that leverages the prototype's suitability for few-shot learning, and constructs a reward model based on human feedback. The reward score generated from the output is then used to train the reinforcement learning model.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">I worked on a project focused on analyzing thoracic movement and respiratory patterns in patients with Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) using dynamic MRI sequences. I applied optical flow techniques to estimate feature point motion, extracting key information about thoracic movement, including dynamic trajectory and speed during different respiratory phases. Additionally, I segmented the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles to analyze their movement, speed, and shape trajectories, creating 3D rendered animations to visualize their motion throughout the breathing process. Through statistical analysis, I identified unique respiratory characteristics among different TIS patient types, which contributed valuable insights for clinical diagnosis and treatment.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">I developed a distributed control system for mobile robot formation in multi-robot collaborative environments. The project addressed key challenges such as obstacle avoidance, dynamic formation selection, and formation tracking. I proposed a decentralized obstacle avoidance strategy that allowed robots to autonomously adjust their formation based on local information. Additionally, I introduced a dynamic formation selection algorithm to estimate global errors from local ones, enabling robots to reconfigure formations during obstacle avoidance while maintaining coordination. I also designed a consensus-based distributed control law to ensure stable tracking of time-varying formations. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we validated the algorithms’ robustness, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This work demonstrated the potential of decentralized control to enhance the performance and flexibility of mobile robot systems in complex real-world scenarios.</p>
